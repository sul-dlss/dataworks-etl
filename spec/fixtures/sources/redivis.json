The scale-up phase was also evaluated using a case study.\n\n**Extension phase**\n\nDuring the extension phase (Years 7-8), PRIME is writing up and disseminating its findings, and partnering with other countries beyond the PRIME network. A main goal of PRIME during this final phase is to help make a significant ongoing contribution to a broader investment in mental health and mental healthcare.\n\nIntervention packages are refined for each country and this will include strengthening maternal mental health intervention delivery where required. A key challenge has been ensuring adequate quality of care, and PRIME teams are implementing robust Quality Improvement (QI) measures in all countries.\n\nPRIME teams are also actively working with partners in additional LMICs to assist in implementing PRIME’s approach in other countries. This assistance takes on various forms, including presenting workshops, taking part in meetings to share the tools and manuals PRIME has developed.\n\n**Impact summary**\n\nThe PRIME mental healthcare plan has been implemented in 3 facilities and their surrounding communities. By December 2014, 172 service providers working in the district had been trained in the provision of mental healthcare.\n\nIn India, no improvement was found in treatment coverage, a small improvement in facility detection and modest improvement in clinical outcomes for individuals with depression and AUD who received care.\n\n"
